Don't publish a book without a cover! Describe this project in a few sentences - what are you trying to achieve with this page, what technologies are you using, etc. This is a decent template for the way that a readme often looks. Make sure to link to the live site and include some sort of image (logo or screenshot). If you need help writing markdown language (the reason the file ends in .md), check out this guide.
